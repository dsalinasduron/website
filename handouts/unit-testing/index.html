    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Testing</span><br>
    <br>
    Unit testing is a very powerful technique for ensuring your code
    meets requirements and specifications. <br>
    <br>
    As a general rule, you should always run/re-run unit tests whenever
    you make any change to working code. This demonstrates the power
    behind unit tests: you feel free to make changes to code as you have
    an easy and quick way of ensuring your changes did not break any
    existing, properly-working code.<br>

    <br>
    In most instances thus far, you have been given unit tests that test
    your implementation of certain methods and classes. <br>
    <br>
    For example, the following unit test for Lab #1<br>
    <br>
    <a target="_blank" href="./Lab1CoinTest.java">Lab1CoinTest.java</a><br>
    <br>
    The <a target="_blank"
      href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/Assert.html">Assert


      API</a>.<br>
    <br>
    A unit test is a method that begins with "<big><tt>test</tt></big>"<br>
    <br>
    Questions:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. How many unit tests are being
      run?<br>
      <br>
      2. How many test cases are being run for <big><span
          style="font-family: monospace;">testSetTails()</span></big>?<br>
      <br>
      3. The <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">assertEquals()</span></big>
      test takes two arguments. Explain what the first and second
      arguments represent.<br>
      <br>
      There is one version of <big><span style="font-family:
          monospace;">assertEquals()</span></big> that takes three
      arguments:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<big><span style="font-family: monospace;">
          assertEquals(double expected, double actual, double delta)</span></big><br>
      <br>
      4. When should this version of <big><tt>assertEquals()</tt></big>
      method used?<br>
      <br>
      5. What is the purpose of the <big><tt>delta</tt></big>
      parameter?<br>
      <br>
      6. Are the different versions of <big><tt>assertEquals()</tt></big>
      an example of method <span style="font-weight: bold;">overriding</span>
      or method <span style="font-weight: bold;">overloading</span>?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
    </div>
    However it is also important to know how to design your own unit
    tests as well. <br>
    <br>
    Download <a target="_blank" href="./Rectangle.java">Rectangle.java</a>
    and insert it into an Eclipse project.<br>
    <br>
    Notice it has <span style="font-weight: bold;">stub</span> methods
    for <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">area()</span></big>
    and <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">perimeter()</span></big>.
    We will write unit tests for these two methods.<br>
    <br>
    In Eclipse, go to <span style="font-weight: bold;">File -&gt; New
      -&gt; JUnit test case</span> and give your file the name <big><span
        style="font-family: monospace;">TestRectangle</span></big> .<br>
    <br>
    Eclipse will create a default test case. What happens when you run
    this test file?<br>
    <br>
    As a class, we will first write the unit test for testing the <big><span
        style="font-family: monospace;">equals()</span></big> method.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The&nbsp; <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">area()</span></big>
    and <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">perimeter()</span></big>methods
are


    not yet implemented. However, we will write the unit test first
    using a practice known as<span style="font-weight: bold;">
      test-driven development</span> (TDD) whereby you write the test
    before writing the implementation of the method being
    developed.&nbsp; TDD is widely practiced in software development and
    its basic premise is that you really shouldn't write something
    unless you know how to test it.<br>
    <br>
    As a class, we will write the unit test for <big><span
        style="font-family: monospace;">testArea()</span></big>,
    followed by implementing the <big><span style="font-family:
        monospace;">area()</span></big> method. You will complete <big><span
        style="font-family: monospace;">testPerimeter</span></big>() and
    the implementation of <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">perimeter()</span></big>
    on your own.<br>
