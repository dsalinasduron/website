    <b>Greedy Coin Game</b><br>
    <br>
    This assignment will involve playing the Greedy Coin game using the
    Red-Blue strategy.<br>
    <br>
    This game and this strategy is described in the following document -
    <a href="./greedy-coins.pdf" target="_blank">Greedy Coins</a>.<br>
    <br>
    Starting Files<br>
    <br>
    - <a href="./GreedyCoinGame.java" target="_blank">GreedyCoinGame.java</a><br>
    <br>
    This program reads in a file consisting of a layout of coins:<br>
    <br>
    - <a href="./file1.txt" target="_blank">file1.txt</a><br>
    <br>
    - <a href="./file2.txt" target="_blank">file2.txt</a><br>
    <br>
    - <a href="./file3.txt" target="_blank">file3.txt</a><br>
    <br>
    - <a href="./file4.txt" target="_blank">file4.txt</a><br>
    <br>
    - <a href="./file5.txt" target="_blank">file5.txt</a><br>
    <br>
    Complete GreedyCoinGame.java by using your LinkedList from Lab 4.
    Your implementation allowed accessing each element in the list by a
    position (beginning at zero). This will require modifying your
    implementation so that it uses generics (a step you had already
    completed for Lab 12.)<br>
    <br>
    The interface with generics:<br>
    <br>
    - <a href="./List.java" target="_blank">List.java</a><br>
    <br>
    Unit test:<br>
    <br>
    - <a href="./TestLinkedList.java" target="_blank">TestLinkedList.java</a><br>
    <br>
    As you read in each coin from the input file, you will place the
    coin in your <font size="+1"><tt>LinkedList</tt></font>. After you
    have read in all coins, apply the red-blue strategy to determine
    which coins you will select.<br>
    <br>
    You may complete this game with (1) a partner, (2) individually, or
    (3) working along with someone. Points will count towards your final
    homework score.<br>
    <br>
    Submit the following files to the Canvas Dropbox:<br>
