<span style="font-weight: bold;">Eclipse Debugger</span><br>
<br>
This will present an overview of how to use the debugger in Eclipse<br>
<br>
A debugger allows you to step through code on a line-by-line basis and
observe how data changes value. The Eclipse debugger is a relatively
simple, yet quite powerful, tool to use.<br>
<br>
This overview uses the following two class files:<br>
<br>
- <a target="_blank" href="./BuggyCode.java">BuggyCode.java</a> (The
buggy code we will debug.)<br>
<br>
- <a target="_blank" href="./TestBuggyCode.java">TestBuggyCode.java</a>
(Unit tests.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's assume you have run <big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">TestBuggyCode</span></big>
and the unit tests indicate the
following error:<br>
<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><img src="./screen-1.png" alt=""><br>
<br>
</div>
<br>
The unit tests tells you what line in the unit test that failed. In
this situation it is line 16 of the unit test which calls the <big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">max()</span></big>
method in the <big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">BuggyCode</span></big>
class.<br>
<br>
We will have to set up the debugger so that we can step through the
buggy code line by line. We do this by setting a <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">breakpoint</span> at the <big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">max()</span></big>
method in the <big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">BuggyCode</span></big>
class. A <span style="font-weight: bold;">breakpoint</span> is a
stoppage point when running a program.<br>
<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><img
 style="width: 567px; height: 637px;" alt="" src="./screen-2.png"><br>
<br>
</div>
<br>
After we have set a breakpoint, we will run the unit test again,
however this time running it under the debugger:<br>
<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><img
 style="width: 890px; height: 961px;" alt="" src="./screen-3.png"><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
The debugger will run each line of code until it reaches the breakpoint
- in this case the <big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">max()</span></big>
method in the <big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">BuggyCode</span></big>
class. <br>
<br>
Once we reach a breakpoint, we can then step through each line of code
line by line. There are in fact a few ways of stepping through code,
however. If a line of code calls another method, we can either <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">step into</span> that method, or <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">step over</span> it. Stepping into a method
allows us to step through that method line by line. However, if there
are no known problems with that method, it is usually best to step over
it which has the effect of running the method, but not requiring the
developer to step through it line by line.<br>
<br>
In this case we have the contrived <big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">printMessage()</span></big>
method which has no bugs, so we will step over that method:<br>
<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img
 style="width: 1487px; height: 1166px;" alt="" src="./screen-4.png"><br>
<br>
<br>
</div>
<br>
After we step over the calls to <big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">printMessage()</span></big>,
we
will step into each of the remaining lines of code in the <big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">max()</span></big>
method. This allows us to examine the variables and their values as we
step through each line of code.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><img
 style="width: 1490px; height: 1044px;" alt="" src="./screen-5.png"><br>
<br>
</div>
<br>
There are two other buttons that are useful - one that resumes program
execution to the next break point (you can have multiple breakpoints)
and another that terminates program execution.<br>
<br>
