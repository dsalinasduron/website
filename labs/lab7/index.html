      </b><b>Queues &amp; Palindromes<br>
        </b></big> <br>
    <b>Overview</b><br>
    <br>
    This lab will first require implementing a Queue interface.
    Afterwards, you will use your queue implementation, as well as
    implementation of a stack from Lab 6, to design a second algorithm
    that detects palindromes.<br>
    <br>
    Only proceed with this lab once you have developed a solution to Lab
    6 with stacks. Be sure you pass the following unit tests for your
    Stack implementation before proceeding:<br>
    <br>
    - <a href="./TestStack.java">TestStack.java</a><br>
    <br>
    <b>Queue Interface</b><br>
    <br>
    You will implement the following interface for a Queue<br>
    <br>
    - <a href="./Queue.java">Queue.java</a><br>
    <br>
    <b>List-Based Queue</b><br>
    <br>
    You will initially use a <big><tt>java.util.ArrayList</tt></big> to
    implement the <big><tt>Queue</tt></big>. Name your implementation <big><tt>ListQueue.java</tt></big>
    . Test your implementation with the following unit tests:<br>
    <br>
    - <a href="./TestQueue.java">TestQueue.java</a><br>
    <br>
    Initially don't be concerned with failing the unit test <big><tt>testArrayQueue()</tt></big>
    - you will implement a queue using an array that at a later step.
    (To avoid a compile error, you should create a class <big><tt>ArrayQueue.java</tt></big>
    and simply stub the methods in the <big><tt>Queue</tt></big>
    interface for the time being.)<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Array-Based Queue</b><br>
    <br>
    Implement the <big><tt>Queue</tt></big> interface using an array.
    Name your implementation <font size="+1"><tt>ArrayQueue.java</tt></font><br>
    <br>
    Provide two constructors:<br>
    <br>
    <big><tt>public ArrayQueue()</tt></big> - which creates a
    default-sized array<br>
    <br>
    <big><tt>public ArrayQueue(int capacity)</tt></big> - which
    specifies an initial capacity.<br>
    <br>
    You will need to also provide an <big><tt>ensureCapacity()</tt></big>
    method. However, this is&nbsp; more difficult that what we have seen
    thus far as you need to create a larger array, but copy the elements
    to ensure the ordering of the queue remains intact. Carefully plan
    how you will design your implementation to support this. The graphic
    below describes how the elements would need to be copied.<br>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote><img alt="" src="./ensure-capacity.png" height="218"
          width="800"><br>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    In this example, the order of the elements in the queue are a, b, c,
    d, e, f (that is, 'a' is at the front of the queue, 'f' is at the
    rear of the queue.)<br>
    <br>
    To copy the elements over to a new array to make room for inserting
    'g', we must copy the elements in the order they appear in the
    queue. Once we have copied them, we can insert g at the rear of the
    new queue.<br>
    <br>
    Notice how the values of front and rear must be adjusted from
    positions in the old array to positions in the new array after the
    elements have been copied. In the original queue<br>
    <br>
    Make sure you correctly pass the <font size="+1"><tt>TestQueue.java</tt></font>
    unit tests.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Palindromes</b><br>
    <br>
    In Lab #6 you used two stacks to detect a palindrome. To complete
    this lab, modify that solution so that it uses a (1) one stack, and
    (2) one queue.<br>
