    <h3>CMPT 202 Data Structures<br>
      Lab 13</h3>
    <h3>Heaps / Priority Queues / HeapSort</h3>
    <br>
    <b>Objectives</b><br>
    <br>
    - Implement a Maximum Heap<br>
    <br>
    - Use the Maximum Heap to implement a priority queue<br>
    <br>
    - Use the Maximum Heap to implement HeapSort<br>
    <br>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <br>
    <b>Create a Maximum Heap</b><br>
    <br>
    The following interface defines basic operations for a heap. This
    may be either a maximum or minimum heap.<br>
    <br>
    - <a href="./HeapInterface.java">HeapInterface.java</a><br>
    <br>
    The following Java class is a starting point for creating a maxheap:<br>
    <br>
    - <a href="./MaxHeap.java">MaxHeap.java</a><br>
    <br>
    Implement the remainder of the <big><tt>MaxHeap</tt></big> class.<br>
    <br>
    Specifics:<br>
    <br>
    - The <big><tt>add()</tt></big> and <big><tt>remove()</tt></big>
    methods are implemented according to the strategies outlined in our
    coverage of <a target="_blank"
href="http://people.westminstercollege.edu/faculty/ggagne/spring2018/202/handouts/heaps/index.html">heaps</a>.<br>
    <br>
    - Remember items in a heap are stored in the array beginning at
    position 1 (leave 0 empty.)<br>
    <br>
    - Notice there is an <big><tt>ensureCapacity()</tt></big> method
    with some of the logic provided. If there is not sufficient room to
    add a new element, double the capacity of the array. (No need for
    prime numbers - just double the size of the array.)<br>
    <br>
    Write a unit test that checks the methods you have implemented work
    correctly. Name your unit test <big><tt>TestMaxHeap.java</tt></big>
    .<br>
    <br>
    Be sure to add a test that triggers the actions in <big><tt>ensureCapacity()</tt></big>.
    I am not supplying my unit test, but will check your solution
    against my test. Be sure to test thoroughly!<br>
    <br>
    *** Be sure to write rigorous unit tests .... don't just write
    something simple so you will pass the test.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Create a Priority Queue</b><br>
    <br>
    The following interface specifies a basic queue (this is the same <big><tt>Queue</tt></big>
    interface we used earlier this semester.)<br>
    <br>
    - <a href="./Queue.java">Queue.java</a><br>
    <br>
    Implement this interface as a priority queue. Your implementation
    will be named <big><tt>PriorityQueue.java</tt></big> and the class
    header will appear as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <big><tt>public class PriorityQueue&lt;T extends Comparable&lt;?
        super T&gt;&gt; implements Queue&lt;T&gt;</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>{</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>}</tt></big><br>
    <br>
    You will use your <big><tt>MaxHeap</tt></big> to implement the <big><tt>Queue</tt></big>
    interface. The implementation of the <big><tt>Queue</tt></big>
    methods should be one-liners as they delegate all work to the <big><tt>MaxHeap</tt></big>.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Testing Your Priority Queue</b><br>
    <br>
    To motivate testing of your priority queue, we will use an example
    from operating systems: An operating system is responsible for
    maintaining all running programs in your system - the operating
    system refers to running programs as <i>tasks</i>. A task has
    several characteristics, for our example we will identify a task as
    having a <i>name</i> and a <i>priority</i>. The name refers to the
    name of the running program (i.e. Chrome), the priority refers to a
    integer value that specifies the relative priority of the task,
    where a higher numeric priority indicates a higher relative
    priority. An operating system will schedule the task with the
    highest priority to run on an available processing core.<br>
    <br>
    The following class identifies a generic task:<br>
    <br>
    - <a href="./Task.java">Task.java</a><br>
    <br>
    Notice Task implements the <big><tt>Comparable</tt></big>
    interface, allowing tasks to be inserted into a priority queue.<br>
    <br>
    The following unit test ensures your priority queue functions
    properly by inserting several <big><tt>Task</tt></big> objects into
    the <big><tt>PriorityQueue</tt></big> and testing they are removed
    according to priority.<br>
    <br>
    - <a href="./TestPriorityQueue.java">TestPriorityQueue.java</a><br>
    <br>
    <b>Implement HeapSort</b><br>
    <br>
    A heap can also be used to implement a heap sort algorithm. We went
    over the general algorithm in class (for a minimum heap):<br>
    <br>
    1. Add all items that need to be sorted into a min heap.<br>
    <br>
    2. Remove the items from the heap, and insert them into the sorted
    array from lowest to highest.<br>
    <br>
    We are using a max heap - not a min heap, but it should be clear how
    you can use a max heap to implement the heap sort.<br>
    <br>
    This portion of the lab will require modifying <a target="_blank"
href="http://people.westminstercollege.edu/faculty/ggagne/spring2018/202/labs/lab12/index.html">Lab




      12</a> somewhat. Switch to your Lab 12 project for completing this
    step.<br>
    <br>
    In Lab 12 you created <big><tt>SelectionSort</tt></big>, <big><tt>InsertionSort</tt></big>,
    <font size="+1"><tt> QuickSort</tt></font>, and <big><tt>MergeSort</tt></big>.
    Create a class <big><tt>HeapSort.java</tt></big> that is designed
    similarly to the other three sorting algorithms, however this will
    require using a heap to sort the array passed to the <big><tt>sort()</tt></big>
    method. This should not be a complicated sorting algorithm as it
    delegates&nbsp; <big><tt>MaxHeap</tt></big> to implement steps 1
    and 2 from above.<br>
    <br>
    To test your implementation, modify <big><tt>SortingTests.java</tt></big>
    (the unit tests for Lab 12) so that it also tests the <big><tt>HeapSort</tt></big>
    . Only proceed when you pass the tests.<br>
    <br>
    Next, modify <big><tt>SortingAlgorithm.java</tt></big> so that it
    includes <big><tt>HeapSort</tt></big> when comparing the different
    sorting algorithms. Check lists of size 25000, 50000, 75000, and
    100000.<br>
    <br>
    How does <big><tt>HeapSort</tt></big> compare to the other four
    sorting algorithms?<br>
    <br>
    What to Submit:<br>
    <br>
    - <big><tt>MaxHeap.java</tt></big><br>
    <br>
    - <big><tt>TestMaxHeap.java</tt></big><br>
    <br>
    - <big><tt>PriorityQueue.java</tt></big><br>
    <br>
    - <big><tt>HeapSort.java</tt></big><br>
    <br>
    Include a comment in your submission as to how the heap sort
    compared to the other three sorting algorithms.<br>
