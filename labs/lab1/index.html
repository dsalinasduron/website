            <br>
            1. Select a partner on your own.&nbsp; The rules are you
            must pair with a new partner each week.<br>
            <br>
            2. Work as a pair to complete the lab. At the end of the lab
            period, make sure to share all files with each partner.<br>
            <br>
            3. Each partner will submit the lab separately. (Submission
            instructions are described later in this lab.) <br>
            <br>
            4. If you do not finish the lab during the lab period, you
            may either get together outside of class to complete it, or
            complete it on your own. If you choose to complete it on
            your own, be sure to indicate this in your submission. <br>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Objectives</span><br>
    The objectives of this lab are:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * To review the Java language<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * To experiment with enumerations<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * To run unit tests<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * To apply some principles of programming and
    software engineering <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Before Proceeding</span><br>
    <br>
    Review the <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.people.westminstercollege.edu/faculty/ggagne/gradingpolicy/gradingpolicy.html">Programming Grading Guidelines</a> for ideas as how to properly write Java
    programs.<br>
    <br>
    This lab involves designing a class called <big><span
        style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">GenericCoin</span></big>,
    that allows you to flip a coin. You will then write a simple tester
    program to test your class, and a more complicated game that uses
    your class.<br>
    <br>
    Define a class <big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family:
        monospace;">GenericCoin</span></big> that represents a coin with
    no value or name.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Using Eclipse, the steps will be as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote><img alt="" src="./step1.png" width="500" height="412"><br>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    Followed by<br>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote><img alt="" src="./step2.png" width="500" height="598"><br>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    Notice we do not provide a <big><b><tt>main()</tt></b></big> method
    at first (we will do so in another class.)<br>
    <br>
    The coin should have a <span style="font-style: italic;">heads</span>
    side and a <span style="font-style: italic;">tails</span> side and
    should be able to tell you which side is up. You should be able to
    "toss" the coin so that it lands randomly either heads up or tails
    up.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 1: Write</span> <big><span
        style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">GenericCoin.java</span></big><br>
    <br>
    Create the class <big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family:
        monospace;">GenericCoin</span></big>. <br>
    <br>
    Remember when writing a Java class, place a comment at the top with
    your name, date, and a brief description of what the class does.<br>

    It should maintain the side (heads/tails) using an <b>enumerated</b>
    data type:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><span style="font-weight: bold;
          font-family: monospace;">public enum CoinSide {HEADS, TAILS};</span></big><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>For your instance variable,
    use this enumeration type <big><span style="font-weight: bold;
        font-family: monospace;">CoinSide</span></big>. You should
    declare a <big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family:
        monospace;">CoinSide</span></big> instance variable in the same
    way that you would declare any other instance variable. However,
    this object can only have two values, <big><span
        style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">CoinSide.HEADS</span></big>
    and <big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">CoinSide.TAILS</span></big>.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Example Usage</b>:<br>
    <br>
    <blockquote><b><font size="+1"><tt>public enum CoinSide {HEADS,
            TAILS};&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // CoinSide is a new data type</tt></font></b><br>
      <b><font size="+1"><tt>CoinSide side;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; // side is of
            type CoinSide</tt></font></b><br>
      <br>
      <b><font size="+1"><tt>. . .</tt></font></b><br>
      <b><font size="+1"><tt><br>
            side = CoinSide.HEADS;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; // sets side to
            heads<br>
            <br>
            . . .<br>
            <br>
            if (side == CoinSide.TAILS) <br>
            {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // some logic is side is set to tails<br>
            }<br>
          </tt></font></b></blockquote>
    <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    This class should include the following methods:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * a constructor that initializes&nbsp; the coin
    at heads<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * three mutators:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o <big><span
        style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">void
        setToHeads()</span></big> - sets the coin to heads<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o <big><span
        style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">void
        setToTails()</span></big> - sets the coin to tails<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o <big><span
        style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">void toss()</span></big>
    - sets the coin randomly to heads or tails. Use <big><tt><b>java.lang.</b></tt></big><big><span
        style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">Math.random()</span></big>
    to set the coin to heads 50% of the time, and tails 50% of the time.
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (If you've
    never used <big><tt><b>java</b></tt></big>.<big><span
        style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">lang.Math.random()</span></big>
    before, read more about it in the <a target="_blank"
      href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/">Java API</a>.)<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <big><span style="font-weight: bold;
        font-family: monospace;">isHeads()</span></big> - returns true
    if the coin is heads<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <big><span style="font-weight: bold;
        font-family: monospace;">isTails()</span></big> - returns true
    if the coin is tails<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * t<big><span style="font-weight: bold;
        font-family: monospace;">oString()</span></big> - returns the
    String "heads" or "tails" based on the side coin <br>
    <br>
    Make sure your class compiles and you implement all of the above
    requirements.<br>
    <br>
    Comment your code as you proceed - it is generally easier to comment
    code <span style="font-weight: bold;">while</span> you write it,
    versus <span style="font-weight: bold;">after</span> you write it.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2: Write a </span><big
      style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">main()</span></big><span
      style="font-weight: bold;"> method to test your class</span><br>
    <br>
    Write a separate class with a <big><span style="font-weight: bold;
        font-family: monospace;">main()</span></big> method that uses
    your <big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">GenericCoin</span></big>
    class. Name this class <big><span style="font-weight: bold;
        font-family: monospace;">UseGenericCoin.java</span></big> . This
    program will only contain a <b>main()</b> method that tosses <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">two</span> coins 100 times each.
    Afterwards, report the percentage of heads for the first coin and
    the percentage of heads for the second coin.<br>
    <br>
    Then report which coin landed heads up most often, and print the
    difference between the number of heads of the two coins. As an
    illustration, your program would print <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">one</span> of the following example outputs<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><span style="font-weight: bold;
          font-family: monospace;">The first coin was heads 3 more
          times.</span></big><br>
      <big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;"></span><span
          style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;"></span></big><br>
      <big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">The
          second coin was heads 7 more times.</span><span
          style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;"></span></big><br>
      <big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;"></span></big><br>
      <big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">Both
          coins had the same number of heads.</span></big><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    Test your classes.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2: Use the provided unit tests
      to check your class</span><br>
    <br>
    Normally, you would write the unit tests first and use them to check
    your class as you wrote the class. However, in this case, I've
    written the unit tests for you. You may use them now to test you
    class.<br>
    <br>
    Download these <a target="_blank" href="./Lab1CoinTest.java">unit
      tests</a> and drag to the same project as your <big><span
        style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">GenericCoin</span></big>
    class. Your project will look similar to the following:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 375px; height:
        204px;" alt="" src="./unit.png"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    You initially may notice there is an error associated with you unit
    test. If this occurs, click on the 'x' next to one of the "<big><span
        style="font-family: monospace;">import</span></big>" statements.
    The following dialog box will appear. Double-click on "Fix project
    setup"<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 694px; height:
        289px;" alt="" src="./errors.png"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    The following dialog box will then appear which allows you to add
    the <b>Junit 4 library</b> to your build path. This should resolve
    any errors.<br>
    <br>
    Run your unit test by right-clicking on the unit test file, and
    selecting <b>Run As</b> -&gt;<b> JUnit</b>:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 400px; height:
        441px;" alt="" src="./runas.png"><br>
      <br>
    </div>
    If your class fails any tests, you should examine which test is
    failing, and fix your class (NOT the unit test)!<br>
    <br>
    [ You must complete through this portion of the lab before beginning
    work on homework #1. ]<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 4: Comment your code</span><br>
    <br>
    You should have commented each of your classes as you completed
    them. <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.people.westminstercollege.edu/faculty/ggagne/gradingpolicy/gradingpolicy.html">Good







      programming style</a> includes:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * using meaningful variable names<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * using proper indentation<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * including a comment block before the program
    that describes what program does and includes your name and the
    assignment<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * including a comment block before each public
    method that describes what the method does and what its
    preconditions (assumptions) are<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * including comments anywhere the code may be
    confusing <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Extra Time? </span><span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Write a game.</span><br>
    <br>
    Write a program in a new class: <big><span style="font-weight:
        bold; font-family: monospace;">CoinGame.java</span></big>. You
    should ask the user to guess whether the coin will be heads or
    tails. Then flip the coin and report if the coin was heads or tails.
    Repeat until the user is done playing.<br>
    <br>
    The <big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">java.util.Scanner</span></big>
    class is a good choice for capturing user input. <br>
    <br>
    After the user is done, report the number of coin tosses, and how
    many times the user guessed correctly. Also include the percentage
    of correct guesses.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lab Handin</span><br>
    <br>
    Demonstrate your program to the SI or me. Next, be sure to share the
    Java files with your partner. This ensures each partner has all
    necessary files. (assuming you developed it on one computer.) Then
    upload your <big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family:
        monospace;">GenericCoin.java</span></big> , <big><span
        style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">UseGenericCoin.java</span></big>
    , and <big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">CoinGame.java</span></big>&nbsp;
(if

you
completed
this
step)







    to Canvas. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Each member</span> in
    the group needs to submit the&nbsp; Java files to Canvas.<br>
    <br>
    The title of your submission should be the names of everyone in your
    group. The message in the message box should be your rating of your
    partner.<br>
    <br>
    Unless you worked alone, everyone should rate their partner(s) in
    the Canvas message box. Your partner should be rated on a scale of
    5-100, based on the following questions: Your partner should be
    rated on a scale of 5-100, based on the following questions:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Did your partner read preparatory materials before
    coming to the scheduled lab? (1-20)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Did your partner do his or her fair share of the
    work? (1-20)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Did your partner cooperatively follow the pair
    programming model (rotating roles of driver and navigator)? (1-20)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Did your partner make contributions to the
    completion of the lab assignment? (1-20)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Did your partner cooperate? (1-20) <br>
    <br>
    If you were completely satisfied with the process, you should give
    your partner a score of 100. If you were not satisfied with the
    process, please provide a breakdown of your partner's rating, and
    elaborate (in as much detail as you wish) on your experience.
