      Basic Snowman</span><br>
    <br>
    Snowman is a fun spelling game whereby the computer chooses a random
    word, and the player must guess it within 6 tries. For each
    incorrect guess, a new part of the snowman is constructed. If the
    player cannot correctly guess the word within 6 tries, an entire
    snowman is completed, and the player loses. (For some odd reason the
    player loses if they can build a snowman.) The player wins if they
    guess the word within 6 tries.<br>
    <br>
    Write a program that plays basic snowman. The computer will choose a
    word at random from a dictionary of possible words. <br>
    <br>
    This program can be written in any style you choose. One simple
    strategy of the output is as follows: (what the user enters appears
    in boldface.)<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: monospace;"><big>_ _ _ _
        _ _<br>
        <br>
        Incorrect guesses = 0<br>
        <br>
        Select a letter: <b>a</b><br>
        <br>
        _ a _ _ _ _<br>
        <br>
        Incorrect guesses = 0<br>
        <br>
        Select a letter: <b>t</b><br>
        <br>
        t does not appear<br>
        <br>
        _ a _ _ _ _<br>
        <br>
        Incorrect guesses = 1<br>
        <br>
        Select a letter: <b>s</b><br>
        <br>
        _ a _ _ _ s<br>
        <br>
        Incorrect guesses = 1<br>
        <br>
        Select a letter: <b>m</b><br>
        <br>
        m does not appear<br>
        <br>
        _ a _ _ _ s<br>
        <br>
        Incorrect guesses = 2<br>
      </big></div>
    <br>
    and so forth. At the conclusion of the game, output either whether
    the player won or lost.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <big><tt>c a p e r s</tt></big><br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <big><tt>Congratulations -
        you won!</tt></big><br>
    <br>
    or<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <big><tt>_ a p _ _ s</tt></big><br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <big><tt>Incorrect guesses =
        6</tt></big><br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <big><tt>I'm sorry, you lost!
        The word was c a p e r s</tt></big><br>
    <br>
    A starting point for this program is as follows:<br>
    <br>
    - <a target="_blank" href="./Snowman.java">Snowman.java</a><br>
    <br>
    which reads in the following textfile<br>
    <br>
    - <a href="./words.txt">words.txt</a><br>
    <br>
    Be sure to set up your Eclipse project similar to what is shown
    below. Otherwise the program <big><tt>Snowman.java</tt></big> will
    be unable to find the file <big><tt>words.txt </tt></big><br>
    <br>

    </blockquote>
    <br>
    <b>Specifics</b>:<br>
    <br>
    Your program should be case-neutral: '<big><span style="font-family:
        monospace;">a</span></big>' is the same as '<big><span
        style="font-family: monospace;">A</span></big>'.<br>
    <br>
    Perform some basic error checking:<br>
    <br>
    - If they enter a character other than '<big><span
        style="font-family: monospace;">a ... z</span></big>' or '<big><span
        style="font-family: monospace;">A ... Z</span></big>' you simply
    ignore the input value and prompt again. (In other words, if they
    enter '$' as a character, you do not check to see if it occurs in
    the word, nor do you count it against one of their guesses.<br>
    <br>
    - Also check if they enter a letter they have already guessed. In
    this case report they have already guessed that letter. Duplicate
    incorrect guesses only count once towards the number of incorrect
    guesses.<br>
    <br>
