    <b>Overview</b><br>
    <br>
    Two numbers are said to be <i>co-prime</i> if their only common
    factor is 1. For example, 4 and 9 are co-prime as their only common
    factor is 1. However, the numbers 4 and 10 are not co-prime.
    (Co-prime numbers are also referred to as <i>relatively prime</i>.)<br>
    <br>
    This assignment will involve writing a Java program that is passed
    two values M and N, and it will determine all the co-prime pairs
    between (1,1) and (M,N). It will present these co-primes by
    outputting them as a grid. For example, the following displays the
    co-prime pairs of of M = 15 N = 15<br>

    <br>
    where an asterisk represents a co-prime pair. The following image
    shows the relative positions of each pair (notice that (1,1) is the
    lower left-hand corner) where the blue circle is the co-prime pair
    (4,9), and the yellow circle indicates (4,10) is not co-prime.<br>

    <b>Assignment<br>
      <br>
    </b> Write a Java program that is passed two parameters representing
    the pairs to generate. Use the following program as a starting
    point:<br>
    <br>
    - <a href="./CoPrimes.java">CoPrimes.java</a><br>
    <br>
    It currently expects two parameters passed on the command line.
    Using Eclipse, parameters are passed to Java programs by the
    following steps:<br>
    <br>
    <b>Run As -&gt; Run Configurations</b><br>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote><img alt="" src="./step1.png" width="500" height="592"><br>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    and then<br>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote><img alt="" src="./step2.png" width="600" height="477"><br>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    Modify CoPrimes.java so that it displays the co-primes as shown in
    the above figures (that is, an '*' if the coordinates (i,j)
    represent a co-prime, or a space if it is not a co-prime pair.)<br>
    <br>
    <b>Hint</b><br>
    <br>
    Consider how the Euclidean method of determining the greatest common
    divisor may be helpful at solving this problem.<br>
